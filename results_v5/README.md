# Protocol-v5 results

No Protocol-v5 experiment has been executed in this package.

Future runs use this immutable convention:

```text
results_v5/
  protocol-v5.0.0/
    E1|E2|E3|E4|E5|E6/
      <run-id>/
        manifest.json
        raw/
        derived/
        report/
```

Raw observations are preserved separately from derived metrics and narrative
reports. Run directories and provenance files are exclusive-created. The only
overwrite escape hatch is an explicit development override for non-observed
development work; it is prohibited for confirmatory and `OBSERVED` packages.
